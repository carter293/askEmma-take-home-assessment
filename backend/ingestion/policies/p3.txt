Section 3: Mobility & Moving
Falls are a common risk among service users and must be handled with immediate care and attention to prevent further injury.
* If a service user has fallen, first assess their physical state. Check for any signs of injury such as bruising, cuts, or difficulty moving.
* Ensure the service user is in a safe, comfortable position before attempting to assist them.
* If the service user can stand with support, help them to a chair or bed. If not, seek further assistance from another carer.
* If a service user falls, you must email your supervisor immediately with details of the incident, including the time, location, and condition of the service user.
* If this is a recurring issue (two or more falls in a week), cc the Risk Assessor on the email and arrange for a moving and handling risk assessment review to address potential hazards and ensure the service user’s environment is safe.
