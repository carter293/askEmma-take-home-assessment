Section 7: Nutrition and Hydration
Ensuring that service users are well-nourished and hydrated is vital for their overall health and well-being.
* Carers should prepare and serve meals that meet the dietary needs and preferences of service users, taking into account any allergies or medical conditions.
* Offer fluids regularly to prevent dehydration, especially in warmer weather or if the service user has difficulty communicating.
* Document any significant changes in eating habits, such as a refusal to eat or a sudden change in appetite, and report this to your supervisor.
* For service users on a specialised diet (e.g., diabetic, low-sodium), ensure that all meals adhere to the dietary guidelines provided.
