Section 6: Infection Control
Infection prevention is a key responsibility for all social care workers, especially when working with vulnerable populations.
* Always wash your hands before and after providing care to a service user.
* Use PPE such as gloves, aprons, and masks, as appropriate for the task at hand.
* Disinfect equipment and surfaces regularly, especially in shared living spaces.
* If a service user is diagnosed with an infectious illness (e.g., flu, COVID-19), isolate them according to guidance and report the case to your supervisor.
* Follow proper waste disposal protocols for clinical waste, including dressings, gloves, and other materials.
