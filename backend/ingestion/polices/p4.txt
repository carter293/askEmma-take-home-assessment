Section 4: Personal Care and Dignity
Maintaining the dignity and privacy of service users is essential in all personal care activities.
* Always ensure privacy by closing doors and drawing curtains when providing personal care.
* Ask for the service user’s consent before beginning any personal care tasks and explain what you are going to do.
* Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to maintain hygiene and reduce infection risks.
* Respect the service user’s preferences for bathing, dressing, and other personal care routines, ensuring they feel comfortable at all times.
* If the service user expresses discomfort or refuses personal care, document the incident and email your supervisor. If this happens more than once, also cc the service user’s family for further support.
* If PPE is unavailable during personal care, email your supervisor and document the issue immediately.
