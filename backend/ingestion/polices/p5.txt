Section 5: Mental Health and Emotional Well-being
Mental health is a critical component of overall well-being and should be monitored closely.
* Carers should be aware of changes in a service user’s behaviour, including signs of depression, anxiety, or withdrawal from social interactions.
* Regularly check in with service users to ensure their emotional needs are being met.
* If a service user expresses feelings of hopelessness, isolation, or distress, report this immediately to the supervisor.
* In cases where a service user calls in confused, disoriented, or excessively worried, alert their family or next of kin to inform them of the situation and ensure appropriate follow-up care can be arranged.
* Support plans should include mental health considerations, and services users should have access to mental health support if needed.
