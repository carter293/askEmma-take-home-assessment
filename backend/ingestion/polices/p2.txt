Section 2: First Aid and Emergency Response
Social care providers may encounter situations requiring basic first aid or emergency response.
* Minor injuries such as cuts and scrapes should be cleaned and dressed following first aid procedures.
* In case of more serious injuries, such as suspected fractures, or if the service user is unconscious, contact emergency services immediately.
* In the event of bleeding or a medication overdose, carers should contact the service user's GP immediately for further guidance.
* If the GP is unavailable and the situation appears life-threatening, call 999 for urgent medical support.
