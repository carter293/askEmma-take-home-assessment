Section 1: Medication Administration
Medication management is an important aspect of care provision, and all carers must adhere to proper procedures when administering medications.
* Carers should check the service user’s care plan to ensure they understand the medication schedule and dosage.
* Confirm with the service user before administering any medication, and ensure they take it as prescribed.
* If a service user refuses medication, do not force them. Instead, document the refusal and report it to your supervisor.
* In cases where the service user appears confused or unaware of their medication routine, notify the family and seek guidance.
* Regular medication reviews should be scheduled, and any changes to prescriptions must be updated in the care plan.
